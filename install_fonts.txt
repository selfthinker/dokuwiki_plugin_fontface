===== Installation Instructions =====

The settings depend on the embedding technique you use.

==== Uploaded font (@font-face) ====

You need to upload at least two files into the plugin's "fonts" directory to accomodate the majoriity of all the different browsers:

  * <fontFile>.ttf
  * <fontFile>.woff

Optionally you can also add:

  * <fontFile>.eot
  * <fontFile>.svg
  * <fontFile>.woff2

Here you will find ready-made font packages which will already contain all or most of them:

==== Google Font ====

You don't need to upload any files. You can use any of the fonts listed here:

You can add variants into the "fontFile" option, e.g. 'Expletus+Sans:regular,bold'.
